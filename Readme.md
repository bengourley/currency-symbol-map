import currencyToUTFSymbolMap from 'currency-symbol-map/utfmap'

console.log(currencyToSymbolMap)
// =>
{
 "USD": "$",
 "GBP": "£",
 …
}

### 4.0.0
- the reverse lookup feature was removed (retrieving currency given a symbol) because
there is not a deterministic way to do so (i.e. the same symbol is used by multiple currencies).
- in previous versions, an unsuccessful lookup would return the `'?'` character. It now returns
`undefined` so that it is up to you how to handle the failure.
